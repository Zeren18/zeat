            Rex Lapis is the God of Contracts as well as the source for Teyvat's currency, Commerce, and the Warrior God â€” among many other names. 
            He was the Geo Archon and is the oldest of "The Seven," and possibly being one of the oldest, 
            if not the oldest, gods at over six thousand years old. 
            He is shrouded in a plethora of legends; both true and exaggerated, 
            often depicting him as an all-conquering, powerful deity. In addition to forming the geography of the region he governs, 
            Rex Lapis defended Liyue in great battles such as the Archon War, which was waged in the area that
            is now Guili Plains against other gods. After retiring,  Rex Lapis resides in Liyue Harbor as Zhongli
             and works as a consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
